        <p>I enjoy reading and listening to music. I am also committed to sharing what I'm reading more publicly so that perhaps folx can get some inspiration for what they want to read next and also in reverse, I can find some inspiration from others for what I can read next. In addition, I hope to use this as a way to figure out an accountability mechanism for myself to read more diverse voices, both within the US and also globally.</p>

                <p>For 2020 (and hopefully beyond), I plan on tracking every single book and album I've consumed and doing a monthly round up (save for 2020 itself, because...you know).</p>

                <p>I definitely want to read as many different voices as possible, but also want to share and amplify the voices that really resonated with me. Here are a few lists of books that I particularly enjoyed by voices who are not white cis hetero men.</p>
