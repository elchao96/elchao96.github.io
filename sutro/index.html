        <p>Every single day during 2019, sometimes multiple times a day, I took a picture of Sutro Tower from my
            apartment, using a camera mounted on a tripod that (mostly) stayed in the same place. I then stitched all of
            these photos together into a video, which you can watch below.</p>

        <p>Over the course of the year, it was really cool to see the changes to the tower, particularly the moment
            when
            the third tower was taken down for repairs. It was also neat to see that you could witness mundane
            moments
            like sunsets and fog rolls, natural occurrences, while also getting to see deliberate man-made moments
            like
            the Pink Triangle going up and down during Pride Weekend, or the third tower being taken down for
            repairs in
            November.</p>
