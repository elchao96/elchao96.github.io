	<br><p> I don't necessarily watch TV, but over spring break I had nothing to do so I caught up on a few TV shows. One of which was glee which I used to watch, but then stopped so I could focus on school and I love it a lot. Teen wolf I actually didn't stop watching it was really the only TV show I continuosly watched, but last season was pretty bad so hopefully it'll get better. American Horror Story a lot of people recommended to me so I decided to watch it and if you get scared easily then you probably shouldn't watch it. Adventure Time I watched a lot over the summer and then school started so I stopped watching it and then I started watching it over winter break and spring break. It's kind of weird, but I'm pretty sure that's why I like it.</p>
