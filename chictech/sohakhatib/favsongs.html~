	<br> <p> I really like to listen to music and some of my favorite artists are Rylie Brown who is not very known, but she was was on the X Factor last year and she is amazing and I think you should definitely check her out. I also really like One Direction because I mean they're amazing singers and great people, but not all of their songs are that great, but I mean they don't write their own songs. Midnight Memories was pretty cool though. I also really like 5 Seconds of Summer who I found out about through One Direction when they opened for them in their last tour. They've gotten really big in the past year, but they're amazing singers, but once again their songs aren't that great. Then I really like Little Mix who I found out about when they were on the X Factor and they have amazing voices and really good songs. </p>
