# Disappointment

**by Emily Chao**

When I didn't make National Merit,
I disappointed them.

When I refused to go for a 36,
I disappointed them.

When I was rejected from an Ivy League,
I disappointed them.

When I chose not to study what they wanted,
I disappointed them.

When I refused to take the job that looked better on paper,
I disappointed them.

When I didn't have a date by the time I graduated,
I disappointed them.

When I dated a woman,
I disappointed them.

When I refused to back down from my life
When I remained steadfast in my identities and my choices
When I finally set a boundary with them that I refused to compromise
I disappointed them.

*but my self-worth is more than just their approval*
