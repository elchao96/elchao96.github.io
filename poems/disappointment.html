    <h1>Disappointment</h1>
    <p><strong>by Emily Chao</strong></p>
<p>When I didn't make National Merit,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I refused to go for a 36,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I was rejected from an Ivy League,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I chose not to study what they wanted,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I refused to take the job that looked better on paper,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I didn't have a date by the time I graduated,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I dated a woman,<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p>When I refused to back down from my life<br />
When I remained steadfast in my identities and my choices<br />
When I finally set a boundary with them that I refused to compromise<br />
I disappointed them.</p>
<p><em>but my self-worth is more than just their approval</em></p>
