We are also working to develop apps that these role models would then teach hands-on activities to these girls. Be sure to support us on Indiegogo <a href="igg.me/at/misspossible">here</a>!</i></p>

		<h3>This Website - In Progress</h3>
		<p><i>I started my online portfolio as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project, I mastered basic web development by coding in HTML, CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. I implemented a novel feature which includes portfolio viewers. It's still a work very much in progress, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.</i></p>

		<h3>Where's Waldo International - Facebook Hackathon, Nov. 2013</h3>
		<iframe src="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bifft2" height=300px width=700px></iframe>
		<p><i>Three team members and I programmed a game of Where's Waldo. Using the Google Maps API, we give Waldo a random location around the world. The player first receives a Javascript message with a clue for the player to guess which continent Waldo is on. Once the right continent is identified, the player is given a Google Maps marker and can move it around the continent until Waldo is found. There is a hot-cold bar at the top of the map to indicate how close or far away the player's current pointer location is from Waldo's actual location. Once Waldo is found, the player is given a score out of 100 based on the time taken to find Waldo. The player can share the game via different social media sites.</i></p>
