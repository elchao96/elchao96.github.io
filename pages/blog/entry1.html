<h1>Entry 1: Schrodinger's Principle</h1>
<h3><i>January 12, 2014</i></h3>
<p>I sit down with my father to have lunch at one of our favorite Chinese restaurants. He orders one of the dishes from his usual rotation while I ordered my usual. Not fearing the diabetic sweep, we order a couple of side dishes as well. Then it's only a matter of time before our steaming hot, MSG-filled plates of food are placed before our hungry eyes.</p>
<p>The conversation shifts around from family matters to what movie we plan to see today. Until out of the blue, I get quiet and think real hard.</p>
<p>"Dad?" I say, in between mouthfuls of curry noodles. "You know,  Schrodinger's Principle?"</p>
<p>He nods, after taking one bite of his beef and rice. I knew the answer already. Of course he knows. He's taken graduate-level physics. Of course he knows.</p>
<p>Schrodinger proposed the uncertainty of electrons' positions within the electron cloud outside the atom's nucleus. It's in strong correlation with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The famous cat example: you place a cat in a box and the box is closed. Judging from your current situation, you don't know if the cat is dead or alive. And somewhere along the line, we add in the fact that if you make the move to observe, you have the possibility of ruining the experiment just from your observation.</p>
<p>He asks me why I bring this up. "It's like my future, Dad," I reply.</p>
<p>The future is exactly the way we see it. Vague, uncertain, random. It's like that Ellie Goulding song, "Anything can happen." Yet, if we try to understand or even try to envision what our future would look like, we risk ruining aspects of our future just by our attempt to do so.</p>
<p>It's a scary void to be in, because I've planned ahead my whole life. When some dreams weren't fulfilled (many, in fact), when many failures occurred, I rewired, rewrote, and reprogrammed that plan to pursue other goals. Now, as I sit there while staring at a bowl of noodles, I'm not so certain if that plan will work out. I'm not so sure anymore.</p>
<p>Do I really know what I want for myself in 5 years? 10 years? 20? Can I be sure that this will lead me to happiness?</p>
<p>Who was I?</p>
<p>I was the child who excessively planned everything, even using Excel to map out educational paths until three in the morning. I was the child who rebelled against her parents, choosing to chase a career they didn't approve of. I was the child who tried her hardest to meet high standards and expectations set by her family, yet balked and ended up short.</p>
<p>Who will I be?</p>
<p>I will be, well, I don't know.</p>
<p>Who do I think I can be?</p>
<p>I can be me. The future may be uncertain and may have surprises in store for us, but we can be us. Just us. Who we are. Not the person who others may have wanted us to be, but the person we see in ourselves.</p>
<p>I'm still on my way to realizing this concept into reality, but once I got that down, the future, even with all its uncertainty, may not need me to try to scrutinize it. Once I find myself, I may just let myself be immersed in the now, trying new things, meeting new people, understanding new concepts.</p>
<p>Because the future's an experiment not to be tampered with.</p>
