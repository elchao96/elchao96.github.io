    <h3>By Day</h3>
    <p>I currently work as a software engineer at <a class="link" href="https://recidiviz.org">Recidiviz</a>, working on
      tools
      and
      data platforms that shed light on ways to nudge criminal justice systems in the US towards decarceration.
      Previously, I was an ML engineer at <a class="link" href="https://about.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, working on
      detections and remediations that support user trust
      and
      safety and prevent harassment, abuse and manipulation in online discourse on the platform. I graduated from the <a
        class="link" href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> with a B.S. in Computer
      Science. I'm currently living on unceded Ohlone land (Oakland, CA).</p>
    <p><i>Areas of Interest</i>: trust and safety in online discourse, ethical and fair ML/AI,
      technology
      policy, socio-political and justice-oriented technology</p>

    <h3>By Night</h3>
    <p>I help organize the <a class="link" href="https://ebabz.org/">East Bay Alternative Books and Zines Fest</a> and
      am also helping to steward <a class="link" href="https://school.logicmag.io/">Logic School</a>. I dabble in
      creative writing, street and landscape photography as creative art practices. I also enjoy cooking Chinese
      food, reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy novels, poetry and graphic novels, watching anything animated,
      curating and degendering
      fashion, and listening to
      albums from beginning to end.</p>
    <p><i>Causes I Care About</i>: Asian American political solidarity, Black Lives Matter, prison and police abolition,
      urbanism, anti-capitalism</p>
